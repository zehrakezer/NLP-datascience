       " 'thought that rotj was clearly the best out the three star wars movies find surprising that rotj considered the weakest installment the trilogy many who have voted seemed like rotj was the best because had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie personally like the empire strikes back lot also but think slightly less good than than rotj since was slowermoving was not episodic and just did not feel much suspense emotion did with the third moviebr also seems like that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being inferior film the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared the sheer excellence the film whole have heard many strange reasons such because yoda died because bobba fett died because small ewoks defeated band stormtroopers because darth vader was revealedbr would like debunk each these reasons because believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares bobba fett died george lucas wanted him die then wanted him die dont get wrong fan bobba fett but made few cameo appearances and was not lucas intention make him central character the films that star wars fans made him out his name was not even mentioned anywhere the movie you had the credits find out bobba fetts name judging rotj because minor character died bit much think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure was momentous period the movie was not happy see him die either but makes the movie more realistic all the good guys cant stay alive realistic movie you know otherwise all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect this point about people not liking yodas death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi new hope many consider new hope the best the trilogy why was obi wans death okay but yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers impossible that utterly ridiculous can not believe this one first off the ewoks are their native planet endor they are cognizant their home terrain since they live there you watch the movie carefully many the tactics the ewoks used defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use their home field advantage since you lived the forest all your life hope you would have learned use your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware the advantages the forest the only thing they had was their blasters add was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted the band rebels that conquest thought that the stormtroopers were have defeated combination the star wars heros the band rebels well the huge clan ewoks with great familiarity their home terrain that would have been great upset lastly this scene was still unbelievable you how about empire strikes back new hope where there were several scenes group consisting just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were full view and not only that the heroes course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then least empire strikes back the battle endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not heroes against legion stormtroopers dont believe check out the battle cloud city when our heroes were escaping landos base when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot somehow they missedas han solo and luke were trying exit the death starbr the last reason that care discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for spend time here that people did not like darth vader being revealed well many ways that was major part the plot the movie luke was trying find whether not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker would have been disappointing the movie had ended without luke getting see his fathers face because made complete annakins revelation symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed the dark side his helmet and the good person was annakin skywalker removing the helmet the point that annakin died converted the light side again and that what the meaning the helmet removal scene was about fact thats what would have done that scene too were lukes fatherisnt that what you would have done you wanted see your son with your own eyes before you died and not mechanized helmetbr another note think subconscious conscious expectation among most people that the sequel must worse even better that preceding movies another reason that rotj does not get many accolades deserves never into film with that deception mind always try into film with the attitude that well might better worse that the original but can not know for sure lets see that way with open mind and not dupe myself into thinking that clearly superior film not good really wasbr not sure who criticizes these movies but have asked many college students and adults about which their favorite star wars movie and they all tell except for one person that said that new hope was their favorite that rotj believe that the results these polls are appalling and quite misleadingbr bottom line the return the jedi was the best the trilogy this movie was the only one the three that kept riveted all throughout its minutes there was not moment boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising all the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father rotj was better than the one the empire strikes back any daybr finally hope people see the phantom menace with open mind because fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details see just another sequel trash the movie such this movie stinks because luke not then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will the subject derision like rotj suffered unfortunatelybr',\n",
